1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    When you are working in a team so everyone can have access to the files or if you want to access it from different computers.


2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    Because you can control whether or not to commit the changes you made instead of having git going something that you may not need or like.


3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    Fork is a copy of a repo on GitHub (from and to). Clone is a copy from GitHub to your local repo or just another copy in your local computer. Branch is another "path" or "way" inside your repo (local or remote) like 'master' or 'origin' with the same goal, keeps tracking your changes.


5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
    I would use email, or some kind of storage like dropbox. The problem would be that without git or GitHub is hard to keep tracking the files and the changes specially with more people making different changes at the same time.


6. When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
    When you wanna change something in your code you are not sure whether or not it's gonna work and when you wanna check with your team or collaborators if that change is good or not. The benefits are that you don't mess with your master branch so you keep it as the original and correct branch making it organised.
